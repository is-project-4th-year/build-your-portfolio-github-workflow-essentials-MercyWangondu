## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### 🔀 Branching  
Branching helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different parts of the site, such as the header, about section, skills, and deployment setup. By working on each task in its own branch (e.g., `feature/01-header`, `feature/02-about-projects`), I was able to test, commit, and merge independently without interfering with the main codebase.

### ✅ Issues & Milestones  
Using GitHub Issues allowed me to clearly define each task, such as “Add About Section” or “Style Certificate Cards,” and then track their progress. Linking issues to Milestones gave me a timeline and grouped related tasks (e.g., all certificate-related work under the “Skills & Certificates” milestone), making the development process feel organized and intentional.

### 📋 GitHub Project Boards  
The GitHub project board visually mapped my entire portfolio workflow from planning to completion. I created a board with “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done” columns and added all my issues as cards. As I worked on each feature, I could move the card to reflect the status — just like using Trello or a kanban board. This helped me stay focused and motivated, especially seeing progress as tasks moved to “Done.” It also allowed quick tracking of what was pending, in progress, or complete without having to dig into commits.

### ⚔️ Merge Conflict Resolution  
By editing the same line of code in two branches (`feature/email-red` and `feature/email-blue`), I intentionally triggered a merge conflict. This helped me understand how conflicts occur and how to resolve them. I used GitHub’s built-in conflict resolution tool to manually select and merge the correct version of the conflicting code. This practical experience showed me how to collaborate effectively on team projects where code changes might overlap.
